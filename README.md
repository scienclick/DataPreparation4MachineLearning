# Data Preparation Steps for Machine Learning


## Motivation

This note book is supposed to be my reference for different steps required for data wrangling and clean up. This is going to be much larger file, as I gradually copy my learnings and my old records here. Currently it is the bear bone version, but itâ€™s going to be built on it. I hope it would be helpful for others too.

## Usage example

This repository is going to be a recording place for typical steps in data preparations, and everyone can benefit from. End of this file would be the beginning of ML exercise, which is not covered here.


## Requirements

The major libraries used in these projects are:
1. numpy,
2. pandas,
3. scickitlearn,
4. matplotlib,
5. encodings


## File structure

There is a data set called *bp2018.csv*  in this project which contains *British Petroleum energy outlook in 2018*. Any other data set can be used, and there is nothing special about this particular file.

The notebook file is called **DataPreparation4MachineLearning.ipynb** and includes the following sections:

** Part 0: loading data**
** Part 1: Getting to know the data**
** Part 2: null value investigation**
** Part 3: dropping duplicates**
** Part 4: Converting the object to appropriate type and parsing dates**
** Part 5: Imputation**
** Part 6: Getting dummy variables**
** Part 7: Finding and removing outliers**
** Part 8: Scaling and Transforms**
